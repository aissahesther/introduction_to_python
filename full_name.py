#exemple
#you want 2 variables to represent a first name and a last name respectively

#and then want to combine those values to display someone's full name


first_name ="esther" 
last_name = "aissah"

full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"

print(full_name)

#make the title() method act on the variable name

print(f"hello, {full_name.title()}!")
